    Windows 10 Utility To Inject DLLS

  supported_platforms:
    - windows

- name: Shared Library Injection via /etc/ld.so.preload
  description: |
    This test adds a shared library to the `ld.so.preload` list to execute and intercept API calls. This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during the exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.
  supported_platforms:
    - linux
  input_arguments:
    path_to_shared_library:
      description: Path to a shared library object
      type: Path
      default: ../bin/T1055.so
  executor:
    name: bash
    elevation_required: true # indicates whether command must be run with admin privileges. If the elevation_required attribute is not defined, the value is assumed to be false
    command: |
      echo #{path_to_shared_library} > /etc/ld.so.preload

- name: Shared Library Injection via LD_PRELOAD
  description: |
    This test injects a shared object library via the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to execute. This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during the exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.
  supported_platforms:
    - linux
  input_arguments:
    path_to_shared_library:
      description: Path to a shared library object
      type: Path
      default: /opt/AtomicRedTeam/atomics/T1055/bin/T1055.so
  executor:
    name: bash
    elevation_required: false # indicates whether command must be run with admin privileges. If the elevation_required attribute is not defined, the value is assumed to be false
    command: |
