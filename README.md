# Thremulate

Thremulate is a light weight adversary emulation application grounded on the MITRE [ATT&CKâ„¢](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.
Thremulate's server and agent are totally platform independent. Therefore, you can execute over 157 adversarial techniques on Windows, Linux and MacOS operating systems without a hitch.

> Thremulate is currently undergoing quality assurance to fix bugs. Therefore not all adversary techniques will work as expected. It will soon be production ready :ok_hand:. Keep checking for its v1.0.0 release.

## Why should I use Thremulate?
- **Security Assessments for All:** 
Organizations that may not have full time red team personnel or IT security budget constraints or irregular security assessments can leverage the power of this software to test their defenses.
- **Security Monitoring Effectiveness:**
Security personnel should validate their continuous and/or network security monitoring measures effectiveness at preventing and/or detecting adversarial behavior on the end-points or network. Thremulate helps you do this with utmost ease. Run an adversarial technique and confirm if it is prevented or detected as malicious.
- **Raise Information Security Awareness:**
The lead author created Thremulate to raise awareness about cyber threats out there in the wild (unknown) inclined on compromising and/or destroying digital infrastructure. Thremulate is a spot-on example of how we can use Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) to reinforce our defenses.
