# Thremulate

Thremulate is a light weight adversary emulation application grounded on the MITRE [ATT&CKâ„¢](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.
Thremulate's server and agent are platform independent. Therefore, you can execute over 140 adversarial techniques on Windows, Linux and MacOS operating systems. 

> Thremulate is currently in the quality assurance (QA) stage to identify and fix elusive bugs. This QA stage is still in progress and has so far been done on Windows and Linux systems only. MacOS will soon join the process. Therefore not all adversary techniques will work as expected. 

We promise, it will soon be production ready :ok_hand:. 


## Why should I use Thremulate?
- **Know Your Gaps in Detection:** 

  Security Administrators that desire to identify their organisation's gaps in detecting adversarial presence, can ably  use Thremulate to do so.

  **Security Assessments for All:** 
  Organizations that may not have a substantial IT security budget that supports regular red team engagements are able to leverage the power of Thremulate to test their defenses.

- **Security Monitoring Effectiveness:**
  Security personnel should validate their security monitoring effectiveness at preventing and identifying adversarial presence on the network. Thremulate helps you do this with utmost ease. Run an adversarial technique and confirm that its execution is stopped or detected as malicious.

- **Raise Information Security Awareness:**
The lead author created Thremulate to raise awareness about cyber threats out there in the wild inclined on compromising and/or destroying digital infrastructure. Thremulate is a spot-on example of how we can use Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) to validate and reinforce our defenses.
